DAS3 is the third generation of the Dynamic Arm Simulator, a musculoskeletal model of the shoulder and arm. The arm simulator is developed as part of the NIH contract “Brain-Controlled Hybrid Functional Electrical Stimulation”, led by Dr. Robert F. Kirsch at Case Western Reserve University.

The model was originally developed for real-time simulation.  When used together with a suitable visualisation environment, the DAS3 model can provide a virtual reality tool, with a human in the control loop, for testing brain interfaces for functional electrical stimulation (FES) [1].

However, the model comes with an API that allows other types of applications.  Offline simulations (faster or slower than real time) can be performed to simulate experiments or do optimization of control systems.  Trajectory optimizations can be done using collocation methods to do state estimation, predictive simulations, or design optimization [2].

This repository is provided for users to install the most recent version.  We hope that users will contribute to the project.

To use DAS3, the following environment is needed:
- Matlab 2018b or later
- Opensim 4.0 [3] 
- Opensim Matlab API [4].  Run the Opensim GUI once before installing the Matlab API to ensure that the user folders are created properly.
